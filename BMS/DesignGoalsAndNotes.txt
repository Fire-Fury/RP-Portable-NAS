Design Goals and Notes for a Lithium-Polymer/Lithium Ion battery pack management system.

Design Requirements:
1.Step up voltage from Lithium-Polymer battery pack’s +3.7-4.2V to a steady 5V required to power Raspberry Pi.

2.Prevent over charging and over discharging of the connected Lithium Ion/Lithium Polymer battery pack.

3.Incorporate a USB-C or MicroUSB port to charge the attached battery pack or to supply power to Raspberry Pi computer.

4.Switch from battery power to cable-supplied power seamlessly when plugged in. And vice-versa.

5.Charge the attached battery.

Prospective components:
1. MicroUSB female receptacle
2. TX Instruments LM26221 Low Input Voltage, Step-up DC-DC converter
